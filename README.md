# Simple REST API server

Using express and mongoDB

If you want to try it out

1. Clone this repo
2. Move into the project directory and run `npm install`
3. Run `node index` to run the project

If you want to play around and debug, you could install nodemon for better development experience by running `npm install -g nodemon`. In that case, to take advantage of nodemon, you have to run `nodemon index` .

I took help from [this](https://medium.com/@dinyangetoh/how-to-build-simple-restful-api-with-nodejs-expressjs-and-mongodb-99348012925d) great article
